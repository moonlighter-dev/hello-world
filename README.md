# hello-world
My First Repository on GitHub

Hi, I'm moonlighter-dev!
I'm currently expanding my coding skills.
So far, I know HTML and CSS.
I'm learning JavaScript.

I care about creating effective processes for the people in my world.
In the past, I worked with different operating systems, virtual machines, and data tables.
Now, it's time to get under the hood, so to speak!

My ultimate goal is to develop an integrative POS system that will help my family's business run smoothly.
I also build websites for people who are less skilled than I am.
I want more flexibility and efficiency than I can get using Wordpress.

I have a lot to learn, and I'm interested in learning and sharing with others.
Social trauma is a part of my history so I do not participate in antagonistic communication.
If a project gets too large to preserve the human aspect, I will downscale.
I work to preserve interpersonal communication, dismantling systems that promote bullying and trolling.
If you don't like that, go enjoy the world we live in, because I will be changing it for the better!

Thanks for stopping by!
